* Problems
** Problems
- The quality of the segmentation results depend on the choice of a particular affinity graph, which depends on the neighborhood topology and pairwise affinities between nodes, which can be pixels or superpixels 
- A basic requirement for a desirable affinity graph is sparsity.
- Fixed local neighborhood topology fails to capture long-range connections and usually causes oversegmentation
- Long-range affinity graphs built with a larger neighborhood radius produce dense graphs, thus yields a heavier computational cost
** Slove method
To meet the requirements of sparsity and long range simultaneously, 
a novel unsupervised spectral segmentation algorithm by 
constructing an affinity graph using $l_0$ -sparse representation
* Main idea
** Main idea
 Find a sparse representation of each superpixel 
over a large dictionary containing all the other 
superpixels by solving a $l_0$ - minimization problem.
- Considering the superpixels as the vertices of a graph;
- Refine the sparse representation by considering the
 spatial location information between superpixels as a penalty of the global searching and representation strategy.
** Two Advantages:
- The proposed algorithm can provide meaningful segmentation results;
- The algorithm can produce meaningful results with $K = 2$ for most images in the Berkeley Segmentation Database (BSD).
* Extracting multi-features over multi-scale superpixels
** Extracting multi-features over multi-scale superpixels
- Oversegment the input image into multiscale superpixels with
 either the Mean Shift algorithm (MS) or the
 Felzenszwalb-Huttenlocher (FH) graph-based method 
- Compute for each superpixel different 
features (mean value in Lab color space (mLab) and CLBP) 
to obtain a discriminative affinity graph.
* Construction of the $l_0$ affinity graph
** Construction of the $l_0$ affinity graph
*** Notations
- $I$: an oversegmented image;
- $S=\{s_i\}_{i=1}^N$: the collection of its superpixels;
- $N$: the number of regions in the oversegmented image;
- $x_i^{mLab}\in \mathbb{R}^3$ and $x_{i}^{CLBP}\in \mathbb{R}^{256}$
are single feature normalized vectors extracted from $s_i$.
- Two feature vectors:\\
$\{x_1^{mLab},\cdots,x_N^{mLab}\} and \{x_1^{CLBP},\cdots,x_N^{CLBP}\}$;
**  Construction of the $l_0$ affinity graph
- Define the sparse representation dictionary 
$D=[x_1,\cdots,x_N]\in \mathbb{R}^{m\times N}$ 
(m = 3 for mLab and m = 256 for CLBP) for each feature
 vector $\{x_1,\cdots,x_N\}$. 
- For each $i\in \{1,\cdots,N\}$, consider the following
 $l_0$ -minimization problem
  \begin{equation}
  \label{eq:1}
  \hat{a}^i=argmin_{\alpha}\{||x_i-D\alpha||^2_2,\alpha\in \mathbb{R}^{N},||\alpha||_0\leq L,\alpha_i=0\}
  \end{equation} 
\begin{itemize}
\item where $ \alpha \in \mathbb{R}^N$ runs over all
 sparse representation vectors;
\item the $l_0$ norm $||\alpha||_0$ is the number 
of non-zero coefficients in $\alpha$;
\item the parameter L controls the sparsity of the representation.
\end{itemize}
** Construction of the $l_0$ affinity graph 

In other words, the vector $\hat{\alpha}^i$ is associated
 with the best representation of $x_i$, in the $l_2$ norm,
 as a linear combination of at most $L$ elements among
$x_1,\cdots,x_{i-1},x_{i+1},\cdots,x_N$.

*** Drawback
This representation is only featurefeature-based and does not really incorporate spatial constraints, which may be
 a drawback for segmentation purposes where objects are supposed 
 to be connected
*** How to solve?
 Discard the farthest superpixels. 
 
**  Construction of the $l_0$ affinity grap
***  Construction of the $l_0$ affinity graph
- $k_1,\cdots,k_h$ denote the indices of the removed superpixels;\\
Then recompute the sparse representation in Eq. (1) in a very constrained way:
- Restrict to all $\alpha$ such that $\alpha_j = 0$ whenever $\hat{\alpha}_j^i = 0$
- $\alpha_{k_1}=\alpha_{k_2}=\cdots=\alpha_{k_h}=0$
- $\dot{\alpha}^i$ denote the updated sparse representation vector;

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:2}
r_{ij}=||x_i-\dot{\alpha}^ix_j||_2^2
\end{equation}
- The similarity coefficient $w_{ij}$ between superpixel $s_i$ and superpixel $s_j$ is defined as
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:3}
f(x) =
\left\{
  \begin{array}{ccc}
   1 & if\quad i=j\\
1-(r_{ij}+r_{ji})/2 & if\quad i\neq j
  \end{array}
\right
\end{eqnarray}
*** Construction of the $l_0$ affinity graph 
- $W=(w_{ij})$ denote the similarity matrix.
- All steps above are applied to both feature vectors $\{x_1^{mLab},\cdots, x_N^{mLab}\}$ and $\{x_1^{CLBP},\cdots,x_N^{CLBP}\}$
- yield two matrixs $W^{mLab}$ and $W^{CLBP}$;
- Therefore two $l_0$ graphs $G^{mLab}=\{S,W^{mLab}\}$ and $G^{CLBP}=\{S,W^{CLBP}\}$;
- These two graphs can be merged into a single graph $G=\{S,W\}$ where $W=(w_{ij})$ is defined by
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:4}
w_{ij}=\sqrt{(W_{ij}^{mLab})^2+(W_{ij}^{CLBP})^2}
\end{equation}
* Various oversegmented images
** various oversegmented images
- The same procedure can be applied to each oversegmented 
image $I_k,k=1,\cdots,M$.
- Yield the graphs $G_k=\{S,W_k\}_{k=1}^M$.
- The final $l_0$ -affinity graph $G = \{S,W\}$ 
is obtained by a simple concatenation, i.e. 
$W = diag(W_1,W_2,\cdots,W_M)$.
* Transfer cuts and image segmentation
** Transfer cuts and image segmentation
*** Build a Bipartite Graph 
- Input image $I$ and its superpixel set $S$.
- Define $G_B=\{U,V,B\}$
- where $U=I\cup S,V=S$,
- \begin{equation*}
B=
\begin{bmatrix}
W_{IS}\\
W_{SS}
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
- $W_{IS}=(b_{ij})_{|I|\times |V|}$,
** Transfer cuts and image segmentation
- \begin{equation*}
    b_{ij}=
   \begin{cases}
    b,&if \quad $i \in j$\\
   0 ,&otherwise
   \end{cases}
  \end{equation*}
$b$ is a positive constant.
- $W_{SS}$ is the affinity graph between superpixels.
** Transfer cuts and image segmentation
The Tcuts method yields a partition of the bipartite graph
 into $K$ clusters.
- it provides the bottom $K$ eigenpairs
 $\{\lambda_i, f_i\}_{i=1}^K$ of the following
 generalized eigenvalue problem over superpixels only:
\begin{equation}
L_V {\bf f}=\lambda D_v {\bf f}
\end{equation}
where $L_V=D_V-W_V$, $D_v=diag(B^T {\bf 1})$, 
and $W_V=B^TD_U^{-1}B$, $D_U=diag(B {\bf 1})$
* EXPERIMENT ALRESULTS
** EXPERIMENT ALRESULTS
 Standard benchmark image segmentation database, the BSD;
 Quantitative evaluation:Probabilistic Rand Index (PRI)
- Variation of Information (VoI)
- Global Con- sistency Error (GCE)
- Boundary Displacement Error (BDE) 
A segmentation result is better if PRI is higher and
 the other three ones are lower.
